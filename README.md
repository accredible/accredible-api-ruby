# Accredible Ruby SDK
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/accredible/accredible-api-ruby.svg?branch=master)

Overview
--------
The Accredible platform lets you automatically create, manage, and distribute digital certificates or open badges directly from your Ruby codebase.

Digital certificates and badges help maximize the value from your training or certification program. Digital credentials are more accessible and share-able via social media, directing interested viewers back towards your learnersâ€™ achievements and your course website. Track recipient engagement to see shares, additional traffic to your webpage. And, allow students to save and print a PDF for their wall at home.

This gem wraps the Accredible API in Ruby for easy integration into projects. The full REST API documentation can be found here: http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/ 

We forked the original by sublimecoder so that we can provide updates without interfering with their active usage. This repository and gem are the officially maintained Ruby wrappers for Accredible.

Accredible::Credential.create(

Accredible::Credential.update(id:"1234", credential: {name: "new credential name"})

#deleting a credential
cred = Accredible::Credential.delete("1234")

#for viewing all credentials
groups = Accredible::Credential.view_all(group_id: "1234", email: "student@example.com")

group = 
  {
        "name": "new group",
